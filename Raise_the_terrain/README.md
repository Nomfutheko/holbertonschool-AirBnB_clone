Raise The Terrain

About this project
Raise The Terrain is a voluntary project at Holberton School taking part of the "Low-level programming & Algorithm" projects.
It is created using the C programming Language and SDL2.

How it works
The program reads the file "altitudes".
Gets the altitude of each point.
Draws an isometric projection of a grid (64 connected points). Each point has its x, y and z coordinates (z = altitude).
Rotates the grid to Right or Left, when the user presses on Right or Left arrow.
Quits when the user presses ESC key or when clicks on window Quit button.
